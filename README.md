#  Market Simulation & Quantitative Strategy Backtesting on NIFTY Futures

---

##  Overview  
This project explores how a **rule-based quantitative trading strategy** performs in the **NIFTY 50 Futures** market under different volatility conditions.  
Using a **Moving Average Crossover Strategy (MA5 vs MA20)**, I built a Python-based backtesting framework to simulate buy/sell signals, measure performance, and visualize outcomes.  

The primary objective was to evaluate how **market volatility impacts profitability and risk** for a momentum-based strategy, using financial metrics such as CAGR, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.

##  Objectives  
- Design a systematic **trend-following trading model** using moving averages.  
- Simulate trading activity and benchmark results against market performance.  
- Analyze strategy behavior across **low, medium, and high volatility regimes**.  
- Evaluate performance using **CAGR, Sharpe Ratio, and Drawdown** metrics.
